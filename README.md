# Newstroke TTF Project
This is a project dedicating to manually create KiCad's plotter font, Newstroke, into an actual TTF. This font was used in CompassCAD from version 1.3.0 to 1.5.0.

## How you can contribute

To contribute, you should have:
- an SVG export of Newstroke itself
- FontForge

Contributing is easy; change the font file (`*.sfd`), modify its contents, and open up a pull request.
